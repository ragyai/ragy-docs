            "description": "RAG is a process of optimizing the output of a large language model by retrieving relevant information from external data sources. Learn how RAG improves LLM performance, benefits, and challenges for generative AI applications. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts. Why is Retrieval-Augmented Generation important?",
